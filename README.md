# Hi there, I'm a Full Stack Developer! 👋

I am a passionate developer currently pursuing a degree in **Systems Analysis and Development** at **Uniasselvi** (2024-2026). With a strong background in building end-to-end web solutions, I love bridging the gap between robust back-end logic and dynamic front-end experiences.

Currently, I'm expanding my horizons by integrating modern frameworks like **Blazor** and **.NET Aspire** into complex projects.
